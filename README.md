# ISIMIPforest-tools
This repository contains open source tools for ISIMIP forest sector simulations. It aims at enhancing collaboration between involved ISIMIP forest modelers.

scripts/ISIMIP2B-FORMASAM_descriptive-plots.R holds code that produces summary statistics and a visualization for ISIMIP2b simulations

scripts/ISIMIP_ascii2netcdf.R holds the main code for converting model output in ascii format to netcdf format according to the ISIMIP protocol

scripts/ISIMIP_ascii2netcdf_functions.R holds functions that generate netcdfs and is sourced in scripts/ISIMIP_ascii2netcdf.R

Any questions related to the code and repository can be addressed at Mats Nieberg (mats.nieberg@pik-potsdam.de) at the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research.
